## Usage

Before using this package you need to run :
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Froiden\LaravelInstaller\Providers\LaravelInstallerServiceProvider"
```

You will notice additional files and folders appear in your project :
 
 - `config/installer.php` : In here you can set the requirements along with the folders permissions for your application to run, by default the array cotaines the default requirements for a basic Laravel app.
 - `public/installer/assets` : This folder contains a css folder and inside of it you will find a `main.css` file, this file is responsible for the styling of your installer, you can overide the default styling and add your own.
 - `resources/views/vendor/installer` : This folder contains the HTML code for your installer, it is 100% customizable, give it a look and see how nice/clean it is.
 - `resources/lang/en/messages.php` : This file holds all the messages/text, currently only English is available, if your application is in another language, you can copy/past it in your language folder and modify it the way you want.
